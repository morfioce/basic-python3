## 1. Installing Python 3
You need to make sure that you have python 3 installed on your computer.

### 1.1 Windows users
To check if you already have python 3 in your computer, open a terminal (`win + r` then type `cmd`).  
Now type the following command: `python --version`.  
You should see something like this.
!["alt-text"][pyversion]

I highly recommend that you install the anaconda distribution from [here][download-anacoda-win]
